Adapt the provided code structure to create a new generic enum that represents different elements in a new context, not necessarily related to the Matrix. Then, create instances of this enum with different data types and use a match statement to handle them in `main`.



**Plan:**
1. Define a new generic enum with at least two variants, each taking different generic types.
2. In the `main` function, create instances of this new enum using different types for each variant.
3. Implement match statements to handle the different instances based on their variant. Begin by defining the variants for your new generic enum.
