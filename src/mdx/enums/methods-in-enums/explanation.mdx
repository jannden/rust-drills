Just as Neo learns to control his abilities in The Matrix, methods can be defined on enums to perform actions based on their variants.

Neo's choice of the pill has a significant impact on his journey.

```rust
enum Pill {
  Red,
  Blue,
}

impl Pill {
  fn take_action(&self) {
    match self {
      Pill::Red => println!("You've chosen the path of truth."),
      Pill::Blue => println!("You've chosen the path of blissful ignorance."),
    }
  }
}

fn main() {
  let my_choice = Pill::Red;
  my_choice.take_action();
}
```
Here, the `take_action` method is implemented on the Pill enum using `impl`. It interprets the choice made, similar to how Neo's decision shapes his destiny.
