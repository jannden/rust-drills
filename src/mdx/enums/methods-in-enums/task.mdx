Modify the following Rust code skeleton to add a new method to the `Pill` enum that describes the consequences of the choice. Implement the method and call it in `main`.



**Plan:**
1. Add a new method to the `Pill` enum inside the `impl` block.
2. Write logic inside this method to output a consequence based on the pill chosen.
3. In the `main` function, create an instance of `Pill` and call this new method after `take_action`. Start with the first step.
