Using the structure provided, create a new function with match guards that evaluates a different condition. Implement this with a new enum to handle different outcomes.



**Plan:**
1. Define new scenarios in your `NewScenario` enum.
2. Create a function that uses match guards to return different `NewScenario` variants based on a new condition.
3. In the `main` function, set up a condition, call your function, and use a match statement to act on the returned scenario. Start by defining your new scenarios within the `NewScenario` enum.
