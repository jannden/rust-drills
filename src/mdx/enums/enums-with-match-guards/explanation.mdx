Match guards give us the power to do some sensible decision-making processes within enums.

Let's illustrate this with an example where Neo faces different scenarios based on his health status.

```rust
enum Scenario {
  Battle,
  Exploration,
}

fn match_guard(health: u32) -> Scenario {
  match health {
    h if h > 50 => Scenario::Battle,
    _ => Scenario::Exploration,
  }
}

fn main() {
  let neo_health = 30;
  let scenario = match_guard(neo_health);

  match scenario {
    Scenario::Battle => println!("Neo chooses to fight."),
    Scenario::Exploration => println!("Neo chooses to explore."),
  }
}
```

The `choose_scenario` function uses a match guard (`h if h > 50`) to decide the scenario based on Neo's health. If Neo's health is above 50, he chooses to fight. Otherwise, he opts for exploration.
