In the provided Rust code template, modify the use of the `Option` enum to represent a different scenario where a character may or may not have a certain ability. Then, use a match statement to handle both cases.



**Plan:**
1. Change `character`'s value from Neo's title to a character ability or lack thereof.
2. Adjust the match statement to reflect the new context of abilities instead of titles.
3. Test the function with different values for `character`. Start with changing the `character`'s value.
