Use the example as a guide to create a new enum representing different states in another context (e.g., a game, a workflow, etc.). Implement a method for this enum that transitions between its states. Then, demonstrate this transition in the `main` function.



**Plan:**
1. Create a new enum with different states relevant to your new context.
2. Implement a method for this enum that allows for transitioning between its states.
3. In the `main` function, initialize an instance of your enum in one state, transition to another, and print out both states. Begin by defining the states in your new enum.
