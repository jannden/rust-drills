Based on the following skeleton, add a new `Agent` variant with a different attribute and update the `match` statement to handle it.



**Plan:**
1. Define a new variant for the `Agent` enum that holds a unique data type.
2. Instantiate this new variant in the `main` function.
3. Implement a new match arm in the `match` statement to process this new variant. Start by defining the new variant.
