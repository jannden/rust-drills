Refactor the provided code to include a new enum variant and extend the `Action` trait implementation to cover this new character. Additionally, test this new implementation in the `main` function.



**Plan:**
1. Add a new character variant to the `Character` enum.
2. Extend the `Action` trait implementation to include an action for this new character.
3. In the `main` function, instantiate this new character and call the `act` method. Begin by adding the new character to the enum.
