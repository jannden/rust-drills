Utilizing the structure of the provided example, create your own recursive enum to represent a different hierarchical system, such as a file system or an organization structure. Implement a sample instance of this structure in the `main` function.



**Plan:**
1. Define a new recursive enum suitable for your chosen hierarchical system.
2. In the `main` function, construct an instance of this new recursive structure, demonstrating how it can contain instances of itself.
3. Comment on the design choices you made in building this structure. Begin by defining your recursive enum.
