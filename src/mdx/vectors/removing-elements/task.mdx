Following the pattern in the example, write a new Rust program that involves removing elements from a vector in a different context. Describe a scenario where removing an element is significant, and show how you handle the removed element.



**Plan:**
1. Create and populate a mutable vector relevant to your new scenario.
2. Remove an element from the vector, capturing the outcome.
3. Print out the removed element and the updated vector. Begin by creating your vector and deciding which element to remove.
