Your task is to recreate the vector creation and item addition in Rust. Follow these steps:
1. Declare a mutable vector named `frodos_backpack` using `Vec::new()`.
2. Add three items to the vector: 'Lembas Bread', 'Elven Cloak', and 'Sting - the sword'.
3. Print the vector to the console.
Here is the code snippet to start with:

fn main() {
  /* TODO: let mut frodos_backpack = Vec::new();

  frodos_backpack.push("Lembas Bread");
  frodos_backpack.push("Elven Cloak");
  frodos_backpack.push("Sting - the sword"); */

  println!("Frodo's Vector-Backpack: {:?}", frodos_backpack);
}

Start by declaring the mutable vector `frodos_backpack` and then follow the remaining steps.
