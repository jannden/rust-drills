Simply speaking, a vector is a dynamic array that we can resize at will.

Imagine Frodo preparing his backpack for the journey. He needs to store various items in his backpack. If he knew from the beginning how many items will be put in, the backpack could be represented by an array. But since Frodo actually doesn't know how many items he will pack along the way, it's better to have it represented as a vector.

fn main() {
  // Creating an empty Vector
  let mut frodos_backpack = Vec::new();

  // Adding an unknown number of items to the Vector
  frodos_backpack.push("Lembas Bread");
  frodos_backpack.push("Elven Cloak");
  frodos_backpack.push("Sting - the sword");

  println!("Frodo's Vector-Backpack: {:?}", frodos_backpack);

  // Creating a Vector using a macro
  let frodos_backpack_2 = vec!["Lembas Bread", "Elven Cloak", "Sting - the sword"];

  println!("Frodo's Vector-Backpack: {:?}", frodos_backpack_2);
}

There are two ways of creating a vector.
- `Vec::new()` creates a new, empty Vector. The `push` method adds items to Frodo's backpack, just as he would gather supplies for his journey.
- `vec!` macro enables us to initialize a vector in just one line.
