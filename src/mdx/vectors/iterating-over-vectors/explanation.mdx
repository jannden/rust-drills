We can iterate over vectors so that we get access to each element.

Let's imagine that the Ents decide to march against Saruman and each of them wants to announce it.

```rust
fn main() {
  let ents = vec!["Treebeard", "Quickbeam", "Beechbone"];

  // Iterating over the Ents
  for ent in ents.iter() {
    println!("I, {}, am marching to Isengard!", ent);
  }
}
```

In this code, `ents.iter()` creates an iterator over the Vector, allowing each Ent to take action, such as announcing their march.
