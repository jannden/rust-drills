Using the code example as a guide, create a new scenario in which you iterate over a vector containing different elements. Design this new scenario so that each element in the vector has a specific role or action when iterated over.



**Plan:**
1. Define a new vector with distinct elements.
2. Write a for loop to iterate over this vector, using `.iter()`.
3. For each element in the iteration, execute an action that prints out a message or performs some operation. Begin by defining your new vector.
