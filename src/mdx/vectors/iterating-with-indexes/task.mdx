Inspired by the example, write a new Rust program that utilizes `.enumerate()` to iterate over a vector with index tracking. Create a scenario where knowing the index of each element is important. Each element should perform a unique role or function based on its position.



**Plan:**
1. Define a new vector with unique elements suited for your scenario.
2. Use `.enumerate()` to iterate over this vector, keeping track of each element's index.
3. Implement logic within the iteration that uses both the element and its position in the vector. Begin by populating your vector with distinctive elements.
