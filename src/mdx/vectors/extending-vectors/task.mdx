Based on the example, write a new Rust program demonstrating how one vector can be extended by another. Provide a new context for this action, and explain the significance of the resulting vector in that scenario.



**Plan:**
1. Initialize a mutable vector and another vector with different elements.
2. Use the `extend` method to add the second vectorâ€™s elements into the first one.
3. Print out the updated first vector and discuss how this extension impacts the overall scenario. Start by initializing your primary vector.
