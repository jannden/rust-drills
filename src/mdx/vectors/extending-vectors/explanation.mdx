As alliances are formed in Middle-Earth, bringing together different factions for a common purpose, Rust allows the combination of Vectors using the `extend` method. It sounds similar to `concat`, but the difference is that we append all elements of one Vector to another, enhancing the first Vector without creating a new one.

Imagine the armies of Elves and Dwarves joining the forces of Aragorn to stand united against the forces of darkness.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut army_of_men = vec!["Aragorn"];
    let elves_and_dwarves = vec!["Legolas", "Gimli"];

    // The Elves and Dwarves join the coalition
    army_of_men.extend(elves_and_dwarves);

    println!("United Army: {:?}", army_of_men);
}
```

The `extend` method adds the elements of `elves_and_dwarves` into `army_of_men`.
