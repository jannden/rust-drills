The journey through Middle-Earth is unpredictable, requiring flexibility in plans and resources. Similarly, a Vector in Rust has a capacity that can change dynamically.

As the Fellowship prepares for its journey, the members must ensure they have enough supplies, much like managing the capacity of a Vector.

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut supplies = Vec::with_capacity(5);

  supplies.push("Lembas Bread");
  supplies.push("Elven Rope");
  // ... more items are added

  println!("Total supplies: {}", supplies.len());
  println!("Capacity of the backpack: {}", supplies.capacity());
}
```

In this example, `Vec::with_capacity(5)` creates a Vector with an initial capacity for 5 items, ensuring the Fellowship has a pre-determined space for essential supplies. As items are added, Rust automatically increases the capacity if needed, just as the Fellowship might acquire more supplies along their journey.
