Following the provided example, write a new Rust program that demonstrates managing the capacity of a vector in a different context. Explain how items are added and how the capacity changes dynamically. Show this by adding items to the vector and then displaying its length and capacity.



**Plan:**
1. Initialize a new vector with a specific initial capacity.
2. Add various items to the vector, demonstrating how it can grow beyond its initial capacity if necessary.
3. Print out the vector's current length and capacity to showcase the dynamic reallocation. Start by deciding on the initial capacity for your vector.
