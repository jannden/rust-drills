Following the example, write a new Rust program that demonstrates slicing a vector in a different scenario. Create a vector and then use slicing to isolate a specific section of it. Explain the significance of the chosen slice in your context.



**Plan:**
1. Create a new vector filled with relevant elements for your scenario.
2. Utilize slicing to extract a specific portion of this vector.
3. Print out and discuss the significance of the selected slice. Begin by populating your vector with suitable elements.
