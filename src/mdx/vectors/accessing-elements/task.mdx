Alter the given Rust code to illustrate a different scenario where you need to access elements from a different vector. Apply both direct indexing and the `get` method for comparison, and handle the potential outcomes in each case.



**Plan:**
1. Create a new vector with unique elements.
2. Directly index into this vector to retrieve an element and handle errors if the index is out of range.
3. Use the `get` method to safely attempt to access an element, and use a `match` statement to handle the possible `Some` or `None` outcomes. Begin by creating and filling your new vector.
