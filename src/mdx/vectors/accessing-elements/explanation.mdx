Just as members of the Fellowship have different roles, elements in a Vector can be accessed and utilized differently.

Frodo needs to consult different members of the Fellowship for advice.

```rust
fn main() {
  let fellowship = vec!["Gandalf", "Aragorn", "Legolas", "Gimli"];

  // Accessing elements using indexing
  let wizard = fellowship[3];
  println!("The wizard in the Fellowship is: {}", wizard);

  // Accessing elements using get method for safety
  match fellowship.get(3) {
    Some(member) => println!("The fifth member is: {}", member),
    None => println!("There is no fifth member."),
  }
}
```

By using `fellowship[3]`, Frodo can access the first element directly. But what if a member with such an index doesn't exist? We would get an error.

On the other hand, the `get` method provides a safer way to access elements because it returns `None` if the index is out of bounds, like seeking a member not present in the Fellowship.
