Just as characters in Middle-Earth grow and change, elements in a Vector can be modified.

The sword Narsil is reforged into Andúril, symbolizing transformation. Similarly, elements in a Vector can be transformed.

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut weapons = vec!["Narsil", "Glamdring", "Sting"];

  // Reforging Narsil into Andúril
  weapons[0] = "Andúril";

  println!("The reforged weapons: {:?}", weapons);
}
```

Here, modifying the first element of the `weapons` Vector symbolizes the reforging of Narsil into Andúril. Notice that the Vector was initialized as mutable by using `let mut`.
