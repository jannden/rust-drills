Replicate the concept of transformation shown in the example in a new scenario. Create a mutable vector and modify one of its elements to reflect a change or evolution. Explain the significance of the change in your scenario.



**Plan:**
1. Initialize a mutable vector with distinct elements.
2. Change one of the elements to reflect some form of evolution or transformation.
3. Print out the modified vector and discuss the significance of the change you made. Begin by creating and initializing your mutable vector.
