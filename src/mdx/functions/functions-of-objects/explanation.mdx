Functions of objects are called methods or associated functions. They can be likened to the specialized functions of droids in Star Wars. Each droid (object) has unique capabilities (functions).

Let's use R2-D2's methods to hack into the Death Star's mainframe.

```rust
struct  Droid {
  name: String,
}

impl  Droid {
  // Associated function to create a new Droid
  fn  new(name: &str) -> Droid {
    Droid {
      name: name.to_string(),
    }
  }

  // Method for a Droid to hack systems
  fn hack_system(&self) {
    println!("{} is hacking into the system...", self.name);
  }
}

fn main() {
  // Create a new Droid using the associated function
  let bb8 = Droid::new("BB-8");

  // Let the droid use a method
  bb8.hack_system();
}
```

So what's the difference between an associated function and a method? Notice the `&self` part (or sometimes `&mut self`). I am simplifying a little here, but a method has access to the struct itself and can either read it or modify it. An associated function cannot.
