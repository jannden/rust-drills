Based on the example, create a new struct and implement methods and associated functions for it. Reflect on a unique scenario where your struct (akin to a droid) would perform specific tasks through these methods and functions.



**Plan:**
1. Design and implement a new struct with at least one field.
2. Create an associated function that constructs instances of your struct.
3. Implement a method that performs an action or returns information about the instance. Begin by defining your struct and its fields.
