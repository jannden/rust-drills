Inspired by the example, write your own Rust program using a closure in a new context. This closure should capture an environmental variable and use it within its logic. Reflect on why using a closure is appropriate for your scenario, considering factors like scope and reusability.



**Plan:**
1. Define an environmental variable relevant to your new scenario.
2. Create a closure that captures this variable and uses it to perform some logic.
3. Utilize this closure within your main function, applying it to a suitable situation or value. Begin by initializing your environmental variable.
