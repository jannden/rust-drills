Based on the example provided, write a new Rust program that utilizes the `Result` type for error handling within a different context. Design a function that could result in success or failure based on the parameters it's given, and handle both outcomes in `main`. Describe a real-world scenario where this error handling would be analogous.



**Plan:**
1. Create a function that performs a specific task, returning a `Result` type to signify success (`Ok`) or failure (`Err`).
2. Implement logic within this function that determines whether it succeeds or fails.
3. In `main`, call your function and use pattern matching to handle the different outcomes. Start by defining the parameters for your function.
