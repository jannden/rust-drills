Function signatures in Rust are like the mission briefings in Star Wars. They outline what a function will do and what it needs, but we wouldn't care about the internals of the function.

If we want to plan a mission to Endor, we need to define what types of resources are needed (parameters of the function) and what the mission will accomplish (return values of the function).

```rust
fn plan_mission_to_endor(troops: u32, starships: u32) -> String {
  format!("Sending {} troops and {} starships to Endor.", troops, starships)
}

fn main() {
  let mission_plan = plan_mission_to_endor(1000, 5);
  println!("{}", mission_plan);
}
```

A function signature is the name of the function, its parameters, and return values. In our case, the function signature is:
`fn plan_mission_to_endor(troops: u32, starships: u32) -> String`
