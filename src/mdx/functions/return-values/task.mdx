Following the example provided, write a new Rust program with a function that returns a specific value. Use this function within the `main` function and handle the returned value appropriately. Create a context for the function, explaining how the return value is significant in that scenario.



**Plan:**
1. Define a new function that performs a specific task and returns a value.
2. Implement this function to return a relevant value for your scenario.
3. Use this function within `main`, and display the returned value. Begin by deciding what task your function will perform and what type of value it will return.
