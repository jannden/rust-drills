Just as starships return with valuable data or cargo, functions in Rust can return values after execution.

Imagine sending a reconnaissance mission to find a new base for the Rebel Alliance.

```rust
// Function returning the location of a new base
fn scout_for_base() -> String {
  "Yavin IV".to_string()
}

fn main() {
  // Function returning a value
  let base_location = scout_for_base();
  println!("New Rebel base located at: {}", base_location);
}
```

The function `scout_for_base` returns a `String` containing the location of a new base, similar to a successful scouting mission in "Star Wars."
