Based on the example provided, write a new Rust function that takes parameters and is called from `main` with specific arguments. Create a scenario where this function would be necessary and explain how the parameters enhance its flexibility.



**Plan:**
1. Define a new function with appropriate parameters for your scenario.
2. Implement the function to perform a specific task using these parameters.
3. Call this function from `main`, supplying arguments that demonstrate the functionâ€™s utility. Start by defining the parameters for your new function.
