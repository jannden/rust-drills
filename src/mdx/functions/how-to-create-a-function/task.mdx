Using the example above as a guide, create your own Rust function for a different specific task, and call this function from `main`. Provide a brief context for the function and explain its role within the program.



**Plan:**
1. Define a new Rust function that performs a distinct task relevant to your chosen scenario.
2. Implement the logic within your new function.
3. Call this new function from the `main` function to demonstrate its usage. Start by deciding on the task your new function will perform.
