In Rust, a Trait is like a person's character. It defines a set of behaviors (methods) that can be implemented.

Every person has certain abilities (such as speaking) but each does them differently. Similarly, Rust Traits define what a type must do, but not how to do it.

Imagine defining the traits of the Shelby family members.

```rust
// This trait defines how to speak but not what to speak
trait Shelby {
    fn speak(&self);
}

struct ThomasShelby;

struct ArthurShelby;

impl Shelby for ThomasShelby {
    fn speak(&self) {
        // What Tommy says
        println!("I'm Thomas Shelby, and this is my business.");
    }
}

impl Shelby for ArthurShelby {
    fn speak(&self) {
        // What Arthur says
        println!("I'm Arthur Shelby, and I fight for my family.");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let tommy = ThomasShelby;
    let arthur = ArthurShelby;
    tommy.speak();
    arthur.speak();
}
```

As you can see, the `Shelby` trait defines a `speak` method. Both `ThomasShelby` and `ArthurShelby` implement this trait, but each in their way.
