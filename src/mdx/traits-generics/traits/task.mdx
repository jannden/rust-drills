Inspired by the example, create a new Rust program with a trait representing a common behavior and multiple structs implementing this trait in their own unique way.



**Plan:**
1. Define a trait that encapsulates a common behavior.
2. Create at least two structs that will implement this trait, each in a distinctive manner.
3. Implement the trait for these structs, defining how each struct performs the common behavior. Begin by defining your trait and its method.
