Use the Newtype pattern to implement a trait for an external type by wrapping it in a new struct.

**Plan:**
1. Define an external type (or assume one is defined).
2. Create a new struct that wraps the external type.
3. Define a trait with a method.
4. Implement the trait for the new struct.
5. Use the new struct and its trait implementation in the `main` function.
