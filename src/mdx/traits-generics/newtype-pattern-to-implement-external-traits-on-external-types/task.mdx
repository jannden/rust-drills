Using the Newtype pattern, write a new Rust program where you wrap an external type in a new struct and implement a trait for that struct. Choose a scenario where this pattern would be beneficial, possibly to extend or adapt functionality that you otherwise couldn't modify directly.



**Plan:**
1. Define an 'external' type, then create a Newtype wrapping this type.
2. Define a trait with at least one method.
3. Implement this trait for your Newtype, thereby extending or adapting the functionality of the external type. Start by defining your external type and the Newtype.
