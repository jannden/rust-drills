We sometimes face a situation where we need to implement a trait for a type that we didn't create. The Rust's orphan rule forbids that.

The Newtype pattern provides a handy workaround by allowing us to wrap the external type in a new struct, creating a 'new type' local to our crate. We can then implement any trait on this new type.

Imagine if the Shelbys had to adapt an external business tool for their operations, without being able to modify the original tool:

```rust
// Assume `ExternalTool` is a type from a crate we do not own
struct ExternalTool;

// We create a NewType wrapping `ExternalTool`
struct ShelbyTool(ExternalTool);

// We can now implement traits on `ShelbyTool`, even if they are external
trait Adapt {
    fn adapt(&self);
}

impl Adapt for ShelbyTool {
    fn adapt(&self) {
        println!("Adapting the tool for Shelby's use...");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let tool = ShelbyTool(ExternalTool);
    tool.adapt();
}
```

We created `ShelbyTool` as a new type that wraps `ExternalTool`, allowing the Shelby family to adapt and use the tool according to their needs without directly altering the original external type.
