Create a new Rust program that demonstrates using supertraits to establish a hierarchy of traits. Define a basic trait, then build a supertrait upon it, and show how a struct can implement these traits.



**Plan:**
1. Define a basic trait that provides a fundamental behavior or property.
2. Create a supertrait that extends this basic trait with additional functionality.
3. Implement both traits for a struct, demonstrating the trait hierarchy in action. Start by defining your basic trait and the supertrait.
