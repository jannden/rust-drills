Write a new Rust program using trait bounds to enforce that a function accepts only parameters that implement a specific trait. Design a scenario where this constraint is logically applied, and demonstrate the function's operation.



**Plan:**
1. Create a trait and define a behavior within it.
2. Implement this trait for a struct.
3. Write a function that accepts only parameters of types implementing your trait, demonstrating the utility of trait bounds. Begin by defining your trait and its behavior.
