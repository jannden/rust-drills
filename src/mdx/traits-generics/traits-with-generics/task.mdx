Create a new Rust program that combines traits with generics to model different kinds of operations or actions. Implement a trait that can be applied to different types of entities using generics and demonstrate how it works with a function that takes a generic parameter.



**Plan:**
1. Define a trait with a specific behavior or action.
2. Create a generic struct that implements this trait.
3. Write a function that operates on types implementing your trait, showing the generic functionality in action. Begin by defining your trait and its behavior.
