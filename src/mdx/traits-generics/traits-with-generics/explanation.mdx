Combining Traits and Generics brings together the best of both worlds.

Let's expand Shelby's operations to include different types of businesses, each requiring a unique strategy.

```rust
trait Operation {\
    fn run(&self);\
}

struct Business<T> {\
    name: T,\
}

impl<T> Operation for Business<T> {\
    fn run(&self) {\
        let _ = &self.name; // Accessing name\
        println!("Business run successfully.");\
    }\
}

fn main() {\
    let illegal_business = Business {\
        name: "Gambling",\
    };

    illegal_business.run();\
}
```

In this example, the `Operation` trait is implemented for the `Business` struct which also uses generics.

We can't do much with the `name` field of the struct though. Since it's generic, Rust doesn't know what it will be and what it can do. That's why usually, traits with generics rely on trait bounds.

For example, we can require the generic field `name` to implement the `Display` trait from the standard library, so that Rust is sure it can be printed out.

```rust
impl<T: std::fmt::Display> Operation for Business<T> {\
    fn run(&self) {\
        println!("Business {} run successfully.", self.name);\
    }\
}
```
