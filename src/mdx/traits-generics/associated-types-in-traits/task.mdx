Create a new Rust program demonstrating the use of associated types in traits to allow for different implementations to have specific types for their needs.



**Plan:**
1. Define a trait with an associated type and a method that uses this type.
2. Implement this trait for at least two structs, each with a different associated type.
3. Demonstrate how each struct uses its specific associated type through the method in `main`. Start by defining your trait and associated types.
