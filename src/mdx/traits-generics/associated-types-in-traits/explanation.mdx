Within traits, we can define a placeholder type that each implementation of that trait can specify.

Let's say each family member has a trait `Role`. Different roles have different types of duties. So we add a generic placeholder type `Duty` to the `Role` trait.

```rust
trait Role {
    type Duty;

    fn perform_duty(&self, duty: Self::Duty);
}

struct ArthurShelby;

impl Role for ArthurShelby {
    type Duty = String; // Arthur's duty expressed as a task in String format

    fn perform_duty(&self, duty: Self::Duty) {
        println!("Arthur's duty: {}", duty);
    }
}

struct FinnShelby;

impl Role for FinnShelby {
    type Duty = i32; // Finn's duties are typically quantifiable, like the number of shipments

    fn perform_duty(&self, duty: Self::Duty) {
        println!("Finn's number of shipments to manage: {}", duty);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let arthur = ArthurShelby;
    let finn = FinnShelby;

    arthur.perform_duty(String::from("Negotiate with the New York gangs"));
    finn.perform_duty(15);
}
```

In this example, the `Role` trait includes an associated type `Duty`. Each implementation of `Role` specifies what `Duty` is---Arthur's duties are represented as strings (perhaps tasks), while Finn's are numerical (like counting shipments). This allows the `perform_duty` method to accept different types of data for each Shelby family member's role, enhancing flexibility and type safety in the family's operations.
