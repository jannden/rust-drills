Create a new Rust program with a trait that includes a default method. Then define a struct that does not provide its own implementation and thus uses the trait's default method.



**Plan:**
1. Define a trait with at least one method including a default implementation.
2. Create a struct that implements this trait but does not override the default method.
3. In `main`, create an instance of this struct and invoke the method to see the default action. Begin by defining your trait and its default method.
