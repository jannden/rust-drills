Thomas and Arthur are special, but some characters are mundane and don't have their own way of expressing themselves. We can set a default implementation for the `speak` method for such cases.

```rust
// This trait defines how to speak and sets the default implementation
trait Shelby {
    fn speak(&self) {
        // Default implementation
        println!("How are ya?");
    }
}

struct FinnShelby;

impl Shelby for FinnShelby {}

fn main() {
    let finn = FinnShelby;
    finn.speak();
}
```

In this example, `FinnShelby` utilizes the default implementation of the `speak` method from the `Shelby` trait, showing how traits can provide common functionality to different types.
