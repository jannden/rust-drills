Create a new Rust program that utilizes generics to handle different data types within the same structure. Design a scenario where using a generic type makes the code more flexible and reusable.



**Plan:**
1. Define a struct with a generic type parameter.
2. Create instances of this struct with different data types.
3. In `main`, demonstrate how these instances can be used, showcasing the flexibility provided by generics. Begin by defining your generic struct.
