Generics give us the power to write reusable code because we can work with many different data types.

Suppose the Shelbys are planning a new business venture and need a business plan that works with various goods.

```rust
struct BusinessPlan<T> {
    goods: T,
}

fn main() {
    let whiskey_plan = BusinessPlan { goods: "Whiskey" };
    let amount_plan = BusinessPlan { goods: 100 };

    println!("Business Plan 1: {}", whiskey_plan.goods);
    println!("Business Plan 2: {}", amount_plan.goods);
}
```

Here, `BusinessPlan<T>` is a generic struct that has a flexible field `goods`. It can take different types, such as string literal `Whiskey` in the first case or a number `100` in the second case.
