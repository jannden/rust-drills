Using the concepts from the example, write a new Rust program where a function uses generics with trait bounds to ensure it only accepts parameters with certain characteristics. Extend the concept to demonstrate using multiple trait bounds, either inline or with the `where` syntax.



**Plan:**
1. Define at least two traits, each with a distinct behavior or action.
2. Implement these traits for a struct.
3. Write a function (or functions) that accepts parameters with these traits, using trait bounds to enforce this requirement. Start by defining your traits and the struct.
