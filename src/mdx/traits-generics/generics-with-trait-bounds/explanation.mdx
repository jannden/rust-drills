Trait bounds specify what functionality a generic type must provide.

Consider a family meeting where only the members of the Shelby family are allowed.

```rust
trait Shelby {
  fn speak(&self);
}

struct ThomasShelby;

impl Shelby for ThomasShelby {
  fn speak(&self) {
      println!("I'm Thomas Shelby");
  }
}

// It's required that only a Shelby member can attend the meeting
// In other words, the parameter accepts only such an argument
// that implements the Shelby trait
fn attend_meeting<T: Shelby>(member: T) {
  member.speak();
}

fn main() {
  let tommy = ThomasShelby;
  attend_meeting(tommy);
}
```

Here, `attend_meeting` is a function that requires its parameter to implement the `Shelby` trait.

Let's extend the example now to demonstrate multiple trait bounds. The meeting can be attended by two families now, Shelby and Gold. We would update the function signature accordingly:

```rust
fn attend_meeting<T: Shelby + Gold>(member: T) {
  member.speak();
}
```

There is another way to require multiple trait bounds, which is using the `where` syntax. It is usually considered more readable especially as the number of trait bounds grows:

```rust
fn attend_meeting<T>(member: T)
where
  T: Shelby + Gold,
{
  member.speak();
}
```
