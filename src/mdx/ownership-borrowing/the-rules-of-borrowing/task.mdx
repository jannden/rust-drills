Understand and demonstrate the rules of borrowing in Rust through examples. Create a Rust program that shows both valid and invalid uses of borrowing, illustrating each of the two main rules. Use comments to explain why certain lines would cause errors if uncommented.



**Plan:**
1. Show valid and invalid immutable borrowing scenarios to demonstrate the first rule of borrowing.
2. Illustrate valid mutable borrowing and why it must not coexist with immutable borrowing.
3. Create a scenario that could lead to a dangling reference, showing the second rule of borrowing. Start by setting up the main function and the initial resource.
