Demonstrate Rust's borrowing rules by creating immutable and mutable references and ensuring references remain valid.

**Plan:**
1. Create a mutable variable.
2. Create multiple immutable references to this variable.
3. Attempt to create a mutable reference while immutable references are active and observe the error.
4. Ensure references do not outlive the data they point to by managing scopes correctly.
