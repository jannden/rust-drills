There are three core rules of ownership in Rust:

1. Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner.
2. There can only be one owner at a time.
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

Include a code snippet in your explanation where each rule is illustrated through variable assignments and scope changes.

```rust
// Rule 1: Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner
let owner1 = "Some value";

// Rule 2: There can only be one owner at a time
let owner2 = owner1; // Now owner2 is the owner, and owner1 no longer has access

// Rule 3: When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped
{
    let owner3 = "Another value";
    // owner3 is in scope
} // owner3 goes out of scope here, and "Another value" is dropped
```
