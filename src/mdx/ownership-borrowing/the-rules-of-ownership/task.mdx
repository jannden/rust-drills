Understand and apply the principles of ownership in Rust by creating a scenario where these rules are demonstrated.

**Plan:**
1. Illustrate the first rule by assigning a value to a variable, thereby making it the owner.
2. Demonstrate the second rule through reassignment, which transfers ownership.
3. Show how values are dropped when their owner goes out of scope, exemplifying the third rule. Begin by outlining a simple Rust program to illustrate these concepts.
