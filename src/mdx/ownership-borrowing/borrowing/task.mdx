Explore the concept of borrowing in Rust by creating a program where a function borrows data through a parameter without taking ownership. Demonstrate how the original data remains unaffected after the function call.



**Plan:**
1. Define a function that takes a shared reference to a string.
2. In `main`, create a string and pass a reference to this string to the function, showing how borrowing works.
3. After calling the function, use the original data to illustrate that it remains unchanged. Begin by defining your function and its parameter.
