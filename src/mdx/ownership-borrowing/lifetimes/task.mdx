Demonstrate understanding of lifetimes in Rust by creating a program that uses them to ensure reference validity. Implement a function that compares or processes data with borrowed values, specifying lifetimes to manage the scope of the references.



**Plan:**
1. Define a function with lifetime parameters to compare two values and return the longer-lived reference.
2. In `main`, initialize two values and use the function to compare them, illustrating how lifetimes ensure reference validity. Start by defining the function and its lifetime parameters.
