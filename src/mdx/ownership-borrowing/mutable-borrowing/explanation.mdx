Mutable borrowing allows the original to be modified without giving away the ownership of it.

Important: When a mutable borrow is active, there cannot be any other borrow at the same time (whether mutable or immutable).

Mutable borrowing is made with the `&mut` symbol.

For example, the team decides to make a last-minute change to the plan. Only one person can take the pen and adjust the document at a time and nobody can observe while the change is being made. Basher takes the initiative:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut heist_plan = String::from("The Heist Plan");

    let basher_will_modify = &mut heist_plan; // Basher will modify the plan

    basher_will_modify.push_str(" with a Twist");

    println!("Updated Original: {:?}", heist_plan);
}
```

Now, `basher_will_modify` is a mutable reference to `heist_plan`, allowing Basher to modify it. The original must also be mutable, so notice we defined it with `let mut heist_plan`.

No one else can borrow `heist_plan` while it's being changed because of the Rules of Borrowing.
