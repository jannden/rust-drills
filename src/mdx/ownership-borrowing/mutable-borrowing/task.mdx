Demonstrate mutable borrowing in Rust by creating a program where a function or a block of code takes a mutable reference to data, modifies it, and then returns control to the main scope, showing the changes made.



**Plan:**
1. Create a mutable string variable in the `main` function.
2. Define a function that takes a mutable reference to a string and modifies it.
3. Call this function in `main`, then show how the string has changed. Begin by defining the mutable data and the function to modify it.
