Write your own `match` statement in Rust that handles different conditions based on the value of a variable.



**Plan:**
1. Define a variable with a value that will be used in the `match` statement.
2. Add match arms for different conditions based on the value of your variable.
3. Print the message based on the match result.

Start with the first step.
