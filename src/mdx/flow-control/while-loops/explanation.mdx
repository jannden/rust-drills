The ongoing battle for control over Arrakis leads to the endless repetition found in loops.

For instance, perhaps Paul must oversee the harvesting of the spice. Such a process would simply repeat until a quota was filled:

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut spice_harvested = 0;
  let spice_quota = 100;

  // Using a while loop to continue harvesting until the quota is met
  while spice_harvested < spice_quota {
    spice_harvested += 10;  // Harvest 10 units of spice
    println!("Harvested {} units of spice.", spice_harvested);
  }

  println!("Spice quota met!");
}
```

The `while` loop allows Paul to continue the spice harvest until the desired amount is achieved.
