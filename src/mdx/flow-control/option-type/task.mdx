Create your own function that returns an `Option` type in Rust, and use a `match` statement to handle both the presence and absence of a value.



**Plan:**
1. Update `your_function` function that returns an `Option` type with `Some` and `None` variants.
2. In the `main` function, update the `match` statement to handle both the `Some` and `None` variants.

Start with the first step.
