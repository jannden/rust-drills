Nested loops are like the layered strategies in the politics of Dune.

Think of Paul's situation in Arrakeen.

```rust
fn main() {
  let houses = ["Atreides", "Harkonnen", "Corrino"];
  let agendas = ["Trade", "War", "Espionage"];

  // Using nested loops to understand each House's agenda
  for house in houses.iter() {
    for agenda in agendas.iter() {
      println!("House {} and their stance on {}.", house, agenda);
    }
  }
}
```

The nested `for` loops help Paul systematically assess each House's stance on different agendas.
