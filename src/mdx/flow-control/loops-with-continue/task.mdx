Write your own loop in Rust that utilizes the `continue` statement.



**Plan:**
1. Create a `while` loop that will print `distance_traveled` while it's less than 10.
2. Implement an `if` condition within your loop.
3. Inside the `if` condition, trigger the `continue` statement, thus skipping some iterations.

Start with the first step.
