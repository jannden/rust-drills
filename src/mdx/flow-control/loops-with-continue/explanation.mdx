Just as Paul must sometimes make abrupt decisions to either continue his journey or retreat, loop controls in Rust alter the flow of loops.

Paul is searching for a hidden water cache in the desert:

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut distance_traveled = 0;

  while distance_traveled < 10 {
    distance_traveled += 1;

    if distance_traveled % 2 == 0 {
      println!("Continuing search...");
      continue; // Skipping the rest of this iteration
    }

    println!("Searching at distance: {}", distance_traveled);
  }

  println!("Water cache found!");
}
```

In this snippet, `continue` skips to the next iteration under certain conditions.
