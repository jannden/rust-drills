Create your own function that returns a `Result` type in Rust, and use a `match` statement to handle both the success and failure outcomes.



**Plan:**
1. Update `your_function` function that returns a `Result` type with `Ok` and `Err` variants.
2. In the `main` function, update the `match` statement to handle both the `Ok` and `Err` variants.

Start with the first step.
