Create your own infinite loop in Rust that uses the `break` statement to exit the loop when a certain condition is met.



**Plan:**
1. Create an infinite `loop` that will run indefinitely.
2. Implement a condition inside the `loop` that will trigger the `break` statement.
3. Use `break` to exit the loop when the condition is met.

Start with the first step.
