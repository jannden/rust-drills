Like the enduring struggle for Arrakis, infinite loops run indefinitely unless an escape condition is met.

Paul sets up an infinite surveillance loop to guard against sandworm attacks:

```rust
fn main() {
  loop {
    // Check for sandworm activity
    if check_for_sandworms() {
      println!("Sandworm detected! Initiating defense protocols.");
      break; // Break out of the loop if a sandworm is detected
    } else {
      println!("No sandworm activity. Continuing surveillance.");
    }
  }
}

// Dummy function to simulate sandworm detection
fn check_for_sandworms() -> bool {
  // In a real program, this would involve some condition check
  // For illustration, it randomly returns true or false
  rand::random()
}
```

Here, an infinite `loop` runs surveillance until `sandworm_alert` becomes true, at which point the loop is exited using `break`.
