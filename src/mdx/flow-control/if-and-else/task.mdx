Write your own conditional statements that handle different scenarios.



**Plan:**
1. Define at least two boolean variables representing different conditions in your chosen context.
2. Write `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to respond to these conditions. Use `println!` to announce the outcome.
3. Ensure that your conditional statements cover all possible outcomes.

Start with the first step.
