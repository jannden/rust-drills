In the world of Dune, making decisions is crucial for survival, much like using conditional statements in Rust.

Imagine Paul Atreides standing at a crossroads in the desert.

```rust
fn main() {
  let water_still = true;
  let sandworm_nearby = false;

  // Go on if there's water and no sandworm
  if water_still && !sandworm_nearby {
    println!("Paul can refill his water.");
  } else if sandworm_nearby {
    println!("Danger! A sandworm is near.");
  } else {
    println!("No water source found.");
  }
}
```

In this snippet, `if` and `else if` statements help Paul decide his course of action based on the conditions he encounters.
