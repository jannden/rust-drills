Following the pattern from the example, create your own Rust struct to represent another type of object or entity, relevant to a different context or theme. Then, instantiate this struct in the `main` function and print out its properties.



**Plan:**
1. Define your own struct with relevant fields for the scenario you choose.
2. Instantiate your struct with specific values in the `main` function.
3. Print out the properties of your struct instance. Begin by defining the fields for your struct.
