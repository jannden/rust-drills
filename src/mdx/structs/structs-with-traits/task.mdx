Inspired by the example, define your own trait and struct in Rust. The trait should include at least two actions relevant to your struct's context. Implement the trait for your struct, then instantiate the struct and use the trait methods in the `main` function.



**Plan:**
1. Define an enum (if needed) and a struct relevant to your scenario.
2. Create a trait with actions that make sense for your struct.
3. Implement this trait for your struct, providing specific behaviors for each action.
4. In the `main` function, create an instance of your struct and demonstrate the use of the trait methods. Start by defining your struct and its trait.
