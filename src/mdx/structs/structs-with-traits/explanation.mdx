Just as each house has its unique traits, we can define traits to encapsulate shared behaviors across different Rust structs. Traits in Rust are similar to interfaces in other languages; they define a set of methods that can be implemented by structs.

Let's define a trait `HouseTraits` that represents common actions of a noble house, such as hosting a feast or defending its lands. This trait can then be implemented by our `House` struct.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum HouseState {
  AtPeace,
  AtWar,
}

struct House {
  name: String,
  region: String,
  bannermen: u32,
  state: HouseState,
}

trait HouseTraits {
  fn host_feast(&self);
  fn defend_lands(&mut self, additional_bannermen: u32);
}

impl HouseTraits for House {
  fn host_feast(&self) {
      println!("House {} is hosting a grand feast!", self.name);
  }

  fn defend_lands(&mut self, additional_bannermen: u32) {
      self.bannermen += additional_bannermen;
      println!("House {} defends its lands with {} bannermen.", self.name, self.bannermen);
  }
}

fn main() {
  let mut house_baratheon = House {
      name: String::from("Baratheon"),
      region: String::from("The Stormlands"),
      bannermen: 800,
      state: HouseState::AtWar,
  };

  house_baratheon.host_feast();
  house_baratheon.defend_lands(200);
}
```

In this example, the `HouseTraits` trait includes two methods: `host_feast`, which is a read-only action, and `defend_lands`, which modifies the state of the struct. The `House` struct then implements these methods, providing specific behaviors.

Core differences between struct methods and traits:

-   struct methods are specific to a particular struct,
-   traits define a set of methods that can be implemented by multiple types (including structs)
