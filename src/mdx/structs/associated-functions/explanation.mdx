Associated functions represent the cold face of a house shown to strangers. They are related to a struct but don't use information of the struct and neither update the struct.

Creating a new house in Westeros is a significant event and can be represented as an associated function. Notice that the `found_new_house` function has neither the `&self` nor `&mut self` parameter - so it's not a method but just an associated function.

```rust
struct House {
  name: String,
  region: String,
  bannermen: u32,
}

impl House {
  fn found_new_house(name: String, region: String) -> House {
    House {
      name,
      region,
      bannermen: 100, // Default number of bannermen for a new house
    }
  }
}

fn main() {
  let house_tarly = House::found_new_house(
    String::from("Tarly"),
    String::from("The Reach"),
  );
  println!("House {} of {} has been founded.", house_tarly.name, house_tarly.region);
}
```

The function `found_new_house` is associated with the `House` struct now. It creates a new house with a default bannermen number, but it neither reads any info from a `House` and neither updates an existing `House`.

Core differences between struct methods and associated functions:

-   Associated functions don't receive the `&self` / `&mut self` argument, so they don't have access to the struct's properties, but struct methods do.
-   Associated functions are called with the `::` notation as opposed to struct methods which are called with the `.` notation.
