Using the provided example as a template, create your own Rust struct and define an associated function for it. This function should not require access to the struct's instance data, and it should create or perform some operation relevant to the struct. Then, use this associated function in the `main` function.



**Plan:**
1. Define a new struct relevant to your chosen theme or scenario.
2. Create an associated function for this struct that performs a creation or other relevant operation.
3. In the `main` function, create an instance of your struct using this associated function and then perform actions or display the results. Start by defining your struct and its associated function.
