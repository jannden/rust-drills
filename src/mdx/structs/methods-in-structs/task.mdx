Inspired by the given example, create your own Rust struct with a method that changes one of its fields. Design the scenario based on your own interest or a different fictional context. Then, instantiate this struct and use its method in the `main` function.



**Plan:**
1. Define a struct with at least one field that can be changed.
2. Implement a method within this struct that changes the value of that field.
3. In the `main` function, create an instance of your struct and use the method to modify its field. Start by defining the fields of your struct.
