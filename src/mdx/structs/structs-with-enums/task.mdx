Following the example, design your own Rust struct which includes an enum to represent variable aspects of the entity. Then, include a method in your struct to change the state of this enum. In the `main` function, instantiate your struct, change its state using the method, and print the result.



**Plan:**
1. Define an enum with different states relevant to your struct.
2. Create a struct that includes this enum as a field.
3. Implement a method in your struct to change the state of the enum.
4. Instantiate your struct, change its state using the method, and print the updated state in the `main` function. Begin by defining your enum and struct fields.
