Use trait objects either with a smart pointer or a reference to store different types that implement the same trait in a collection, and iterate over the collection to call a trait method.

**Plan:**
1. Create a collection to store trait objects.
2. Create the a function that accepts a trait object and calls it's method.
3. Iterate over the collection and pass each trait object to the function.
