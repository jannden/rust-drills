We can build new traits based on existing ones using supertraits.

The traits of each family member build on one another, each adding layers to their character. This is like saying, "To be a Shelby Leader, one must first be a Shelby."

```rust
trait Shelby {
    fn identity(&self) -> String;
}

trait ShelbyLeader: Shelby {
    fn make_decision(&self);
}

struct TommyShelby;

impl Shelby for TommyShelby {
    fn identity(&self) -> String {
        String::from("Tommy Shelby")
    }
}

impl ShelbyLeader for TommyShelby {
    fn make_decision(&self) {
        println!("{} decides to expand to America.", self.identity());
    }
}

fn main() {
    let tommy = TommyShelby;
    println!("I am {}", tommy.identity());
    tommy.make_decision();
}
```

In this example, `ShelbyLeader` is a supertrait of `Shelby`, meaning that before we can implement `ShelbyLeader`, we must also implement `Shelby`.
