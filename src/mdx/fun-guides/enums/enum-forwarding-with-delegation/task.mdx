Implement a trait for an enum to delegate responsibilities to its variants, allowing each variant to behave differently under the same method call.

**Plan:**
1. Define a trait with a method.
2. Implement the trait for the enum, defining the method's behavior for each variant.
3. Create an instance of one variant and call the method.
