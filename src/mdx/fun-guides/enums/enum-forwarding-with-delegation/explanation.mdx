Enums can delegate responsibilities to their variants, a technique that mirrors the way different characters in "The Matrix" might take on specific roles or actions. This delegation can be implemented using traits and the `impl` keyword, allowing each variant of an enum to behave differently under the same method call.

Let's illustrate this with an example where different characters in the Matrix have unique responses to a situation.

```rust
trait Action {
  fn act(&self);
}

enum Character {
  Neo,
  Morpheus,
  Trinity,
}

impl Action for Character {
  fn act(&self) {
    match self {
      Character::Neo => println!("Neo chooses to fight."),
      Character::Morpheus => println!("Morpheus offers wisdom."),
      Character::Trinity => println!("Trinity hacks the system."),
    }
  }
}

fn main() {
  let character = Character::Trinity;
  character.act();
}
```

The `Action` trait defines an `act` method. Each character variant implements this method differently, signifying their unique response or action.
