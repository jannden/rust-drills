Create an enum with variants that hold data, assign one of its variants to a variable, and use a match statement to handle the different variants.

**Plan:**
1. Create an enum with multiple variants, each holding different types of data.
2. Assign one of the enum's variants to a variable, including the data it holds.
3. Create a match statement to handle the different variants and print the associated data.
