Enums in Rust can also hold data, much like how characters in The Matrix possess unique abilities and attributes.

We can use an enum to represent different agents with distinct powers.

```rust
enum Agent {
  Smith { strength: u32 },
  Brown { speed: u32 },
}

fn main() {
  let agent = Agent::Smith { strength: 100 };

  match agent {
    Agent::Smith { strength } => println!("Agent Smith with strength: {}", strength),
    Agent::Brown { speed } => println!("Agent Brown with speed: {}", speed),
  }
}
```

In this example, each variant of the `Agent` enum carries different data (`strength` for Smith and `speed` for Brown).
