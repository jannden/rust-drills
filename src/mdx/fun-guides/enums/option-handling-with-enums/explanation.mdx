The `Option` enum is one of the pre-made enums in Rust that are used frequently and are very useful. It can represent either `Some` value or `None`.

We can compare the `Option`to Neo's potential to have `Some` title (in his case, it would be 'The One') or `None`.

```rust
fn main() {
  let neo: Option<&str> = Some("The One");

  match neo {
    Some(title) => println!("Neo is {}", title),
    None => println!("Neo is just another human."),
  }
}
```
This snippet uses `Option` to capture the uncertainty of Neo's true identity, showcasing how Rust's enums can express the presence or absence of a value.
