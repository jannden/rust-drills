An Enum is a type that can be any one of several variants. It's similar to how Neo must understand his identity: is he Thomas Anderson, a regular software engineer, or Neo, the chosen one?

Imagine a scenario where Morpheus offers Neo a choice between two pills.

```rust
enum Pill {
    Red,
    Blue,
}

fn main() {
  let choice = Pill::Red; // Neo chooses the Red pill
  match choice {
    Pill::Red => println!("Welcome to the real world."),
    Pill::Blue => println!("Stay in the dream."),
  }
}
```

Here, the `Pill` enum has two variants: `Red` and `Blue`. Neo's choice is represented by one of these variants. The `match` statement then acts like Morpheus, interpreting Neo's decision.
