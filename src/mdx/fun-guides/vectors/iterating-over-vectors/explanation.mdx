We can iterate over vectors so that we get access to each element.

Let's imagine that the Ents decide to march against Saruman and each of them wants to announce it.

```rust
fn main() {
  let ents = vec!["Treebeard", "Quickbeam", "Beechbone"];

  // Iterating over the Ents
  for ent in ents {
    println!("I, {}, am marching to Isengard!", ent);
  }

  // The ents vector is consumed, so this would error out:
  // println!("{:?}", ents);
}
```

After the loop, the vector `ents` is no longer usable because it has been consumed by the iteration. The vector's ownership has been transferred to the loop.

If we want to keep the vector intact, we can use the `iter` method:

```rust
fn main() {
  let ents = vec!["Treebeard", "Quickbeam", "Beechbone"];

  // Iterating over the Ents
  for ent in ents.iter() {
    println!("I, {}, am marching to Isengard!", ent);
  }

  // The ents vector is intact:
  println!("{:?}", ents);
}
```

Now, `ents.iter()` creates an iterator that borrows each element of the vector. The `for` loop iterates over these references. After the loop, the vector `ents` can still be used since its ownership has not been affected by the iteration.
