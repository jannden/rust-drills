Just as the One Ring was ultimately destroyed in Mount Doom, clearing all traces of its power, a Vector in Rust can be completely cleared of its elements.

Imagine a scenario where, after the final battle, the heroes discard their weapons to celebrate the end of the war.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut weapons = vec!["And√∫ril", "Sting", "Glamdring"];

    // Discarding all weapons
    weapons.clear();

    println!("Weapons after the war: {:?}", weapons);
}
```

The `clear` method removes all elements from the `weapons` Vector, leaving it empty. This action reflects the notion of putting aside arms and tools of war, as Middle-Earth enters a period of peace. The `clear` method is useful for resetting a Vector for reuse, without reallocating new memory.
