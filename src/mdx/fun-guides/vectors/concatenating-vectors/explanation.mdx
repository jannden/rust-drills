In the saga of Middle-Earth, different groups often come together to form a larger force, much like how Vectors can be concatenated in Rust to form a larger collection.

Imagine various groups in Middle-Earth uniting for a significant battle.

```rust
fn main() {
    let elves = vec!["Legolas", "Thranduil"];
    let dwarves = vec!["Gimli", "Thorin"];

    // Uniting Elves and Dwarves
    let united_army = [elves, dwarves].concat();

    println!("United army: {:?}", united_army);
}
```

The `concat` method merges multiple Vectors into one. The `united_army` Vector combines the elements of the `elves` and `dwarves` Vectors. This method is pretty useful when you need to join elements from different sources into a new Vector.
