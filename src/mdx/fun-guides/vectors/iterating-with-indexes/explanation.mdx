We can also keep track of the position of iterated items using `.enumerate()`.

Imagine the members of the Fellowship each taking a turn to watch over the camp at night. Their order is crucial because each has a different task or time to start their watch.

```rust
fn main() {
  let fellowship = vec!["Frodo", "Sam", "Merry", "Pippin"];

  // Iterating over the Fellowship members with their watch order
  for (index, member) in fellowship.iter().enumerate() {
    println!("{} takes the watch at hour {}", member, index + 1);
  }
}
```

Here, `fellowship.iter().enumerate()` creates an iterator that yields pairs: the index of each element (starting from 0) and a reference to the element itself. This is very useful when you interact with vector elements and need to know their position.
