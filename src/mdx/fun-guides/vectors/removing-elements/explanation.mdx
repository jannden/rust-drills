In Middle-Earth, certain allies and enemies may leave the journey, just as elements can be removed from a Vector in Rust.

Consider a scenario where the Fellowship must part ways with one of its members.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut fellowship = vec!["Frodo", "Sam", "Gandalf", "Aragorn", "Legolas", "Gimli", "Boromir"];

    // Boromir's departure
    let departed = fellowship.pop(); // Removes the last element

    println!("Departed member: {:?}", departed);
    println!("Remaining Fellowship: {:?}", fellowship);
}
```

The `pop` method removes the last element of the Vector. It returns an `Option`, which is `Some(value)` if an element was removed, or `None` if the Vector was empty, reflecting the uncertainty of partings in Middle-Earth.
