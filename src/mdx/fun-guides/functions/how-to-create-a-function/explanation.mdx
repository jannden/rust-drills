In Rust, functions are like the starships in Star Wars - essential tools to navigate the vastness of coding space.

Consider a scenario where you're preparing a starship for launch.

```rust
// Defining a function to launch a starship
fn launch_starship() {
  println!("Starship launched!");
}

fn main() {
  // Calling the launch_starship function
  launch_starship();
}
```

You can see the `launch_starship` function that focuses on a specific task. That function is called inside of another function called `main`.

The `main` function is like a wrapper to everything - as space is a wrapper to all spaceships. It's the entry point of every program you make in Rust.
