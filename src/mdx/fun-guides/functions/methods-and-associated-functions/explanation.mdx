Methods and associated functions  can be likened to the specialized capabilities of droids in Star Wars.

Let's use R2-D2's methods to hack into the Death Star's mainframe.

```rust
struct  Droid {
  name: String,
}

impl  Droid {
  // Associated function to create a new Droid
  fn new(name: &str) -> Droid {
    Droid {
      name: name.to_string(),
    }
  }

  // Method for a Droid to hack systems
  fn hack_system(&self) {
    println!("{} is hacking into the system...", self.name);
  }
}

fn main() {
  // Create a new Droid using the associated function
  let bb8 = Droid::new("BB-8");

  // Let the droid use a method
  bb8.hack_system();
}
```

So what's the difference between an associated function and a method? Notice the `&self` part (or sometimes `&mut self`). I am simplifying a little here, but a method has access to the struct itself and can either read it or modify it. An associated function cannot.

There is also a difference in how the functions are called. Methods are called on an instance of the struct, while associated functions are called on the struct itself.
