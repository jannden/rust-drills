Like the Fremen traversing predetermined paths across the desert, `for` loops in Rust iterate over a range or collection.

Paul decides to train a group of Fremen warriors.

```rust
fn main() {
  let fremen_warriors = ["Stilgar", "Chani", "Duncan Idaho"];

  // Using a for loop to train each warrior
  for warrior in fremen_warriors.iter() {
    println!("{} is training.", warrior);
  }

  println!("All Fremen warriors have completed their training!");
}
```

The `for` loop iterates over the array of Fremen warriors. Each iteration means there is a training session for a warrior.
