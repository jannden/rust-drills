Implement your own `while` loop in Rust that performs a repetitive task until a specific condition is met.

**Plan:**
1. Construct a `while` loop that will continue to perform a specific task while the mutable variable is lower than the immutable one.
3. Inside the loop, keep updating the mutable variable and print statements to reflect the progression.
