Each house has some specific behavior. We can define those with methods.

Let's say that each house can rally its bannermen for aid. We will implement this action as a method of the `House` struct while adding the number of bannerman as another field in the `House` struct.

```rust
struct House {
  name: String,
  region: String,
  bannermen: u32,
}

impl House {
  fn rally_bannermen(&mut self, additional: u32) {
    self.bannermen += additional;
    println!("House {} now has {} bannermen.", self.name, self.bannermen);
  }
}

fn main() {
  let mut house_arryn = House {
    name: String::from("Arryn"),
    region: String::from("The Vale"),
    bannermen: 500,
  };

  house_arryn.rally_bannermen(300);
}
```

In the example above, the `House Arryn` can use the `rally_bannermen` method to increase the number of its bannermen.
