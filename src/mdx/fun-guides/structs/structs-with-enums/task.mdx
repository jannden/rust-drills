Incorporate an enum into a struct to add flexibility in representing different states. Implement a method to change this state.

**Plan:**
1. Define an enum with multiple variants to represent different states.
2. Create a struct that includes a field of the enum type.
3. Implement a method for the struct to change the state field.
4. Create an instance of the struct and use the method to change its state.
