When we want to group related values, structs come really handy.

For example, we can define each great house in the *Game of Thrones* with some specific attributes, such as name and region.

```rust
struct House {
  name: String,
  region: String,
}

fn main() {
  let house_stark = House {
    name: String::from("Stark"),
    region: String::from("The North"),
  };

  println!("House {} of {}", house_stark.name, house_stark.region);
}
```

We defined a noble house in Westeros as a `House` struct with fields for `name` and `region`.
