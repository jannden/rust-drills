Borrowing must follow two main rules so that memory stays safe.

**The first rule** states that you can have *any number of immutable* references (`&T`) to a resource, or you can have *one mutable* reference (`&mut T`) at any given time, but not both simultaneously.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut heist_plan = String::from("The Heist Plan");

    let plan_for_discussion = &heist_plan; // Immutable reference
    let second_discussion = &heist_plan; // Another immutable reference is fine

    // The next line would error out: can't borrow `heist_plan` as mutable because it's also borrowed as immutable
    // let plan_for_modification = &mut heist_plan;

    println!("Plan for discussion: {}", plan_for_discussion);
}
```

**The second rule** states that references must always be valid.

Just as Danny Ocean would never rely on a team member who isn't dependable, Rust ensures that a reference never outlives the data it points to. This prevents dangling references, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

In our analogy, if a team member leaves the crew, they can no longer participate in discussions or decisions about the heist.

```rust
fn main() {
    let plan_for_modification;

    { // An inner scope starts
        let heist_plan = String::from("The Heist Plan");

        // Let's point plan_for_modification to heist_plan:
        plan_for_modification = &heist_plan;
    } // heist_plan goes out of scope and is dropped here

    // The next line would error out: plan_for_modification contains a reference to a dropped value
    // println!("Modified Plan: {}", plan_for_modification);
}
```

By following these rules, Rust's borrowing system ensures that memory management is efficient and safe.
