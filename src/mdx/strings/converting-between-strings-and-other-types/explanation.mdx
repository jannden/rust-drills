Just as Geralt converts resources found in the Continent into useful items and potions, Rust allows for the conversion between strings and other types.

For instance, Geralt might find an ancient scroll with numbers that need to be used as text or vice versa.

```rust
fn main() {
    let numerical_string = String::from("2024");

    // Converting string to i32
    let year: i32 = numerical_string.parse().expect("Not a number!");
    println!("The year in the scroll: {}", year);

    // Converting a number back to string
    let new_string = year.to_string();
    println!("The year as a string: {}", new_string);

    // Converting a boolean to a string
    let is_witcher = true;
    let status = is_witcher.to_string();
    println!("Is Geralt a Witcher? {}", status);
}
```

Rust can convert different data types with the helpful `parse` method and still keep flexible error handling.
