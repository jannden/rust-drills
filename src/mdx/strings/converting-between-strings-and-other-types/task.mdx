Based on the examples, create your own Rust program that converts between strings and other types. Include at least one conversion from a string to a numerical type, and then back to a string. Also, try converting another data type (like a boolean or float) to a string. Illustrate each conversion step with println! statements.



**Plan:**
1. Start with a string that represents a numerical value. Convert it to the respective numerical type and handle possible errors.
2. Convert the numerical value back to a string.
3. Choose another data type and convert it to a string.
4. Use println! statements to show the results of each conversion. Begin by creating a string that represents a numerical value.
