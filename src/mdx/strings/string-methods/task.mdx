Following the example, use the different `String` methods to manipulate a `String` in your own Rust program. Create a scenario where you would need to check for a word, append text, replace words, and trim spaces in a string. Show how each method affects the string.



**Plan:**
1. Initialize a mutable `String` and add initial text to it.
2. Use `contains` to check for the presence of a specific word.
3. Append more text with `push_str`.
4. Replace a word using `replace`.
5. Trim spaces using `trim`.
6. Print the final `String` to show how it has changed. Begin by creating a mutable `String` and adding some initial text.
