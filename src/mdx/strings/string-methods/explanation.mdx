So we have established that only the type `String` can be changed. Let's now look at the most important options we have for changing it.

Imagine that Geralt wants to update his lexicon with more details. Notice which String methods he might use:

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut lexicon = String::from("Witcher, ");

  // Check if the lexicon contains a specific word
  if lexicon.contains("Griffin") {
    println!("Griffin is already in the lexicon.");
  } else {
    lexicon.push_str("the Griffin slayer, ");
  }

  // Replace a word in the lexicon
  lexicon = lexicon.replace("Witcher", "Geralt of Rivia");

  // Trim any extra spaces
  let trimmed_lexicon = lexicon.trim();

  // Check if the lexicon starts with a specific word
  if trimmed_lexicon.starts_with("Geralt") {
    println!("The lexicon starts with Geralt's name.");
  }

  // Adding the details of Geralt's adventures
  lexicon.push_str("is now resting in an inn.");

  // Print the updated lexicon
  println!("Updated Lexicon: {}", lexicon);
}
```

We can update the lexicon using methods like `contains`, `push_str`, `replace`, and `trim`. Each method is a tool in your arsenal, much like swords and potions for Geralt.
