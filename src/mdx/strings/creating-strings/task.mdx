Using the example provided, try creating strings in Rust using different methods in your own program. You can consider making a small collection of items, phrases, or concepts relevant to your interest or a chosen theme. Demonstrate each method of string creation, then print out the strings along with their lengths.



**Plan:**
1. Use `String::new()` to create an empty string.
2. Convert a string literal to a `String` using `.to_string()`.
3. Create a `String` from a string literal using `String::from()`.
4. Print out each string and its length after creation. Start by creating strings using different methods.
