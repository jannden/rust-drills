Following the steps from the example, experiment with advanced string manipulation in your own Rust program. Create a string and then apply a series of manipulations: reverse it, capitalize each word, and insert a character at a specific index. Use iterators, methods, and collections to achieve these goals. Explain each manipulation with comments and print out the results to show the changes.



**Plan:**
1. Initialize a string to manipulate.
2. Reverse the string and print out the result.
3. Capitalize each word in the original string and print the result.
4. Insert a character at a specified index in the capitalized string and print the final message. Start with creating and reversing a string.
