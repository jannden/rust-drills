Based on the explanations provided, practice using the different string types in Rust by writing your own code snippet. Define a `String`, a string slice, and a string literal in a small Rust program. Manipulate the `String`, reference a section of it for your slice, and print out your literal. Illustrate the differences between these types through your examples.



**Plan:**
1. Create a mutable `String` and add some text to it.
2. Create a string slice from the `String`.
3. Define a string literal.
4. Print all three to demonstrate their usage and differences. Begin by creating a mutable `String`.
