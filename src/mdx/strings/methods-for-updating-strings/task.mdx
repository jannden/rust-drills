Inspired by Geralt's recipe updating methods, try manipulating a `String` in your own Rust program. Add, modify, and remove elements to create a final version of a text. Use the `push_str`, `push`, and `pop` methods, and then combine different pieces using `format!`. Show the changes step by step and explain each modification.



**Plan:**
1. Initialize a mutable `String` and begin with a basic sentence or phrase.
2. Use `push_str` and `push` to add more text or characters.
3. Use `pop` to remove the last character or mistaken addition.
4. Combine your updated string with another text using `format!`.
5. Print out the final combined text to show how it has evolved. Start by initializing your `String`.
