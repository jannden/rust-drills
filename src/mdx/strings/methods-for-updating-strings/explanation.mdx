Like Geralt upgrades his gear and potions, you can add, modify, or remove characters from strings.

Using those options, Geralt decides to update his potion recipe.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut recipe = String::from("Swallow: ");

    // Adding ingredients to the potion
    recipe.push_str("Celandine, ");
    recipe.push_str("Drowner Brain, ");
    recipe.push('W'); // Adding a single character, notice the single quotes

    // Removing the last ingredient (mistakenly added)
    recipe.pop();

    // Combining with another potion recipe
    let enhanced_recipe = format!("{} and Thunderbolt", recipe.trim());

    // Print the final potion recipe
    println!("Updated Potion Recipe: {}", enhanced_recipe);
}
```

Geralt uses `push_str`, `push`, and `pop` to craft and update his potion recipe. The `format!` macro then combines two recipes into one, like mixing ingredients to enhance a potion's effect.
