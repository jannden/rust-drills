Iterating over strings in Rust can be compared to Geralt exploring different regions of the Continent.

Imagine Geralt coming across a mysterious inscription. He needs to analyze it character by character. This is how we might approach it in Rust using a couple of handy methods:

```rust
fn main() {
  let inscription = "Kaer Morhen: Witcher School";

  // Splitting the inscription into words
  for word in inscription.split_whitespace() {
    println!("Word: {}", word);
  }

  // Splitting based on a specific character
  for part in inscription.split(':') {
    println!("Part: {}", part.trim());
  }

  // Iterating over each character
  for ch in inscription.chars() {
    println!("Character: {}", ch);
  }
}
```

Here, `split_whitespace`, `split`, and `chars` methods help Geralt break down the inscription into understandable parts. These methods work on both types of strings (`String` and `&str`).
