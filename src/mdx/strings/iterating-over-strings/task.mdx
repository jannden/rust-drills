Use string iteration methods to analyze a string by splitting it into words, splitting based on a specific character, and iterating over each character.

**Plan:**
1. Split a string by whitespace into words and iterate over the words.
2. Split the string based on a specific character and iterate over the parts.
3. Iterate over each character in the string.
