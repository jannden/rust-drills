Following Geralt's example, write your own Rust code to iterate over a string in different ways. Split the string into words, divide it based on a character of your choice, and then iterate over each character. Use this exercise to familiarize yourself with string manipulation and iteration in Rust.



**Plan:**
1. Create a `String` or `&str` containing a sentence or phrase.
2. Use `split_whitespace` to iterate over and print each word.
3. Use `split` with a specific character to break the string into parts and print each one.
4. Use `chars` to iterate over and print each character in the string. Begin by creating your string and splitting it into words.
